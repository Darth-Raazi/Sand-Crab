# Sand Crab
The Sand Crab is a robotic vehicle with 4 wheels and a claw for grabbing and transporting small objects. The claw is fully 3D-printed, with the original design being taken from Thingiverse and being modified later on. The Sand Crab also features crab steering, so both the front and rear wheels turn together (but in the opposite direction) for a tighter turn radius. Hardware used for the main vehicle includes an Arduino Uno, a DC motor, 4 servo motors, a PWM servo control breakout board and an nRF24L01 radio communication module. 

The Sand Crab is remotely controlled by another Arduino Uno and a Funduino Joystick Shield. The remote control also features 6 buttons, a joystick and an nRF24L01 radio communication module.

All software is written for the Arduino and parts of it were made by adapting code from some online tutorials.
